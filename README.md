The nomenclature script try to find the nomenclature of a given molecule (doesn't work very well; in fact, it works for only some given examples).
The molecule is given by a list of lists who contains strings "name of the atom"+"|"for a veertical connection, "-" else.
(really bad, if there I edit it I will start with changing that for a graph.

The tableau avancement directory contains two scripts.
You need to install kandinsky and ion ("pip install kandinsky" and "pip install ion-Numworks").
You need to launch progress_board.py .
It will display a progress board (I hope a "tableau d'avancement" is called like that in English (I'm french)).
